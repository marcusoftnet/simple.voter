# simple.voter
A very simple voting app

Had great use of [this code](https://github.com/ceoworks/tutorial1-api-koa)

## Todo
* Parameter in URL per event /itspring2017 => itspring2017-questions

## Done
* Some kind of animation for voting and resorting

## Later
* Nice anmiation so that you see stuff moving around
* Do this with redux and an API
* Limit on IP
